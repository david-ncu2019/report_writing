I need to write a report to tell the scholarship provider about what I've done over the past one year. The report will be written based on my first published paper, and the content of my second manuscript.

Here is the first part, I would like to summarize my main activites during period 2024-2025:
- Attend the confernece AOGS 2024 (July 2024, search this for conference information, and briefly describe the conference https://www.asiaoceania.org/aogs2024/) 
- Publish my first paper in MDPI Remote Sensing (here is the link for the paper, https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/20/3789)
- Attend the TGA 2025 (in Taipei, Taiwan) (search this page to briefly describe the conference https://2025tga.tcgu.org.tw/site/page.aspx?pid=901&sid=1620&lang=cht)
- Currently working with the second manuscript (the detail will be showed at the next section)

The second part is talking about the second manuscript, what are the conceptual ideas (why this research should be done), what are the methodology, and what are the results I have got. Then show the future plan for next publication.

please help me draft a report in 2000 words.
